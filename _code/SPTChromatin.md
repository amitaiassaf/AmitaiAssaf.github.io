title: "Modeling chromatin dynamics"
collection: code
excerpt: 'This code describes everything.'


A common approach to study chromatin dynamics is to tag it with a fluorescent mark and follow 
its motion inside the nucleus with a confocal microscope. The end result is a long trajectory. 
A chromatin locus performs complicated stochastic trajectory. We have developed a method to analyze such trajectories.

In a new paper published in cell reports (Amitai, Assaf et al. Cell Reports, 18, 1200 - 1214, 2017), we describe a statistical 
method to estimate four parameters characterizing chromatin dynamics from Single Particle Trajectories (SPTs). 
We provide here our Matlab code to study the time-lapse imaging of single loci by fluorescence microscopy. 
The code can be applied to any trajectories of tagged DNA loci. 
The code allows extracting four biophysical parameters from the movement. 
The method can be used to study the changes following DNA damages or breaks and can be applied to single locus 
trajectories in any species.
