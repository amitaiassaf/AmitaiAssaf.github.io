My name is Assaf Amitai and I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology working with Arup Chakraborty and Mehran Kardar. My research interest lies in applying mathematical analysis, modeling, simulations and statistical physics to understand various processes in biology. In particular, I am currently working on chromatin dynamics, protein dynamics in the nucleus, and various questions in immunology related to infection and vaccination.
